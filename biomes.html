	<h2>The Biomes of Minecraft</h2>
</header>

<h3>Minecraft has tons of different biomes. Biomes are essentially different enviornments or climates that generate throughout the game.
These biomes can have different trees, flowers, mobs, and generation types. Below is a list of just some of the many biomes that Minecraft has to offer.</h3>

<div class="column">
	<h4>The cherry grove contains pink cherry trees and pink flower petals that litter the grass.
	It also has an animation of falling pink flower petals. It also tends to be a hillier biome than others.</h4>

	<h2>Forest</h2>

	<h4>The forest biome is a relatively flat biome, occasionally having small hills. It has birch and oak trees
	along with dandelions and poppys. It also can have mushrooms and ferns. Cows, pigs, chickens, and sheep
	are common in the forest.</h4>

<div class="column"> 
	<h4>As the name suggests, this biome is mountious and has sharp peaks. Most of the biome is made up of stone, although it can 
	contain other blocks such as grass and calcite, as seen in the picture. In this biome, you may find yourself
	running into goats. Another special feature of the stonky peaks biome is emeralds. Emeralds only spawn in mountainious
	biomes and the sharp peaks and cliffs make it an ideal biome for finding emeralds!</h4>
