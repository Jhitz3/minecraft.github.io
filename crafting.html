  </div>
  
<div class="column">
	<h4>To make a crafting table, you first need to get wood planks from the logs of any tree. Putting a log in your
	2 x 2 crafting grid will give you 4 wooden planks. Putting one plank in each of the grid spots will allow you to craft a crafting table.
	Place down the crafting table block and right click it to access it. Here is a 3 x 3 crafting grid which will be utilized in many recipes.</h4>

  </div>
  
<div class="column">
	<h4>This image shows the crafting recipes, from left to right, top to bottom: Pickaxe, shovel, axe, hoe. This image shows the
	recipe using diamonds, but this recipe can be recreated with other ores by switching out the diamonds for the other ores. The ores
	you can use are stone, iron, gold, diamond, and netherite.</h4>

	to smelt things.</h4>

	make.</h4>
